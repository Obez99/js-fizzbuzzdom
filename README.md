# FizzBuzzDom

**Description**:<br>
In this exercise I created a grid that has 100 cells, each of them are printed with their index number in the middle of them using a ***for*** loop.<br>
<br>
- If a cell is a multiple of 3, it's color will be green and "fizz" will be printed inside of it.
- If a cell is a multiple of 5, it's color will be yellow and "buzz" will be printed inside of it.
- If a cell is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it's color will be red and "fizzbuzz" will be printed inside of it.<br>
